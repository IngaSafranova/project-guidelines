# Specifics we want to see

## No off-the-shelf/standard front-end

- We want to see a custom front-end experience, and the reasons why you've chosen to design it like this
- Animations/customsiations can make a big difference, so highlight any points of interest that would be hard to describe

## Diagram depicting how your stack is set up

- We want to see how your technology is set up
- What is your platform built on?
- Where is it hosted?
- How do different parts communicate?

## Day 1 Tip: No coding, just planning and setup

- The only code you should do on Day 1 is right at the end of the day, and that is getting everything set-up together, and then pulled down locally for each team member

## Team splits

- Day 2, 3, and 4 should all be spent pair programming
- We want to see a different pairing each day
- For a team of 5, that might mean 1 person may be on their own each day or a 3, but this should be a different person

## Technical details

- You should be using environment variables where you think it is appropriate
- Bonus points for advanced user interface features
